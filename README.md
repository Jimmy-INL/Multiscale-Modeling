# Multiscale Modeling

This script automates the creation and strain/stress testing for stiffness and strength estimation of a fiber composite on the microscale.

Simple plasticity models are used for matrix material behaviour.

The modelling folder contains all scripts which automates Abaqus commands and simulations.
In the prossessering folder are the scripts for data extraction are placed.

The scripts in the stotte folder are the files which are used for devolpment and setting up the analysis and data visuallisation.

This repository should be cloned to 'C:/MultiScaleMethod/Github/Multiscale-Modeling/' for own convenience.

To test the program run the script "C:\MultiScaleMethod\Github\Multiscale-Modeling\MicroscaleModelling_randomSweep.py" in abaqus.
